TickZOOM(tm) General Public License Version 1.0

Preamble

This license grants you a copy of the source code for TickZOOM
for developing trading strategies and allows you to modify the
source code for your private use only.

However, unlike free software or open source software, this
license disallows copying the program in either binary or source
code format except on your computers or for backup.

Redistributing any of it to others or creating derivative works
to distribute is disallowed.

If you disagree with the terms of this license, you must destroy
all copies in your possession.

Definitions

"This License" refers to version 1.0 of the TickZOOM General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
make or receive copies. This includes interaction with a user through a computer
network.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work. 

Modification of the Source Code

You may modify the source code of the program for private use only. No other
purpose for modification is allowed.

Copies for Private Use Only

The only copies you are allowed to make is a backup to a backup media and use
of the software on computers owned or leased by you. If you make any other copies
or if you propagate or convey the program to others then that constitutes
copyright infringement.

Acceptance Required for Having Copies

Your acceptance of this agreement is required for you to retain copies of this
program in source code or binary format. If you do not accept the terms of this
license then immediately delete and destroy all copies in your possession.

Business Use Limited to 30 Days

The term business is defined as any entity with more than one employee or having
more than two owners or members. Businesses as defined may use this source code
for 30 days. Retaining a copy of this program without written permission beyond
30 days constitutes copyright infringement.

Disclaimer of Warranty

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Interpretation of Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot
be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil
liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
