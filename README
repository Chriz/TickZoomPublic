Setting Up for Git With GitHub

If this is your first time to use Git or GitHub, follow these steps. 

1. Install Git http://cloud.github.com/downloads/tickzoom/TickZoomPublic/Git-1.6.5.1-preview20091022.exe

2. Install TortoiseGit http://tortoisegit.googlecode.com/files/TortoiseGit-1.2.1.0-32bit.msi
   When asked if you want install PLINK or OpenSSH choose OpenSSH

3. Click "Signup" on the upper right corner of the GitHub site. It's free to create an account.

4. Next you need to setup a secure public key with your GitHub account to avoid entering a
   password every time you use Git or TortoiseGit. Follow these steps:
   
   a. Open a Git Bash prompt by right clicking on any folder in Windows Explorer and click "Git Bash Here".
   
   b. At the prompt enter the following command:
   
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.address"
        (Please enter 3 times for default file name, and empty pass phrase.)
        
   c. Now, use Windows Explorer to find your C:\Documents and Setting\[User Name]\.ssh folder.
      Inside it, open the id_rsa.pub file in Notepad.
   
   d. Copy everything in the id_rsa.pub file to the clipboard. You need to paste that into your GitHub account.
   
   e. Now in a browser, open your GitHub account page. In the SSH Public Keys section click
      "add another public key", then paste your key into the key field. If you leave the title
      blank the key comment (your email) will be used for the title.

You have completed setup and install of Git with GitHub. Now proceed with setup of TickZooom.

Setting Up and Using TickZoom via Git

1. You need to "Fork" the TickZoomPublic project on GitHub by clicking the "fork" button on the github site for
   TickZoomPublic. This gives you a personal copy of the project to which you can push changes. Then a developer 
   can "pull" your changes back into the original TickZOOM project.
   
2. After forking you will be on the home page of your "fork" of the TickZoomPublic project. You will find
   2 url links on that page to "clone" your project. Copy the "Your Clone URL" which you can do easily by
   clicking the small arrow to the right of it.

3. Select or create a folder in Windows Explorer where you would like to keep your TickZoomPublic source project.
   Right click on that folder in Windows Explorer and click "Git Bash Here" to open a Git Bash prompt.
   
4. At the prompt enter: git clone [paste Your Clone URL]
   To paste your URL you need to click on upper left corner of the prompt window and select Edit then Paste.
   
5. You will see the progress as it creates the TickZoomPublic folder. It only takes several seconds.

6. Finally, you can navigate to the TickZoomPublic folder in Windows Explorer, then the Platform/TickZoom.sln file
   and open it in either SharpDevelop or Visual Studio. Compile and run the application.
   
7. If you already have a TickZoom folder with subfolders of DataCache, AutoUpdate, etc, TickZoom will "self
   configure" by finding it on any disk drive and attach to it and run.
   
8. If the app never finds a TickZoom folder, then it will select your disk drive with the largest amount of free
   space and create the folder there. You then need to get a user key and download a ZIP file with some sample
   data to get started. Contact Wayne to get your Sample data.
